<p>Girdle is a web application that is a clone of the popular word game Wordle.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><strong>Tech Used: </strong>HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</p>
<br>
<p>
This project utilizes a combination of technologies to create a dynamic and interactive application. Here's a breakdown of the tech stack and their respective roles:

- HTML5: Provides the structural elements and content for the website.
- CSS3: Handles the styling and layout of the website, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing design.
- JavaScript: Implements interactive features like the navigation bar and form validation, enhancing user experience.

A responsive design approach was adopted to ensure a seamless user experience across devices, guaranteeing that the website looks great on all screen sizes.

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Here are some ways that I could increase performance on my website:

These are some popular methods of optimization that I am considering:
- Caching: Utilize caching mechanisms, such as Redis or Memcached, to store frequently accessed data in memory. This can reduce the load on the database and improve response times.
- Asset Bundling: Consider bundling your static assets (CSS, JavaScript) into a single file to reduce the number of HTTP requests required to load the page. This can enhance performance, particularly for larger projects with multiple assets.
- Code Optimization: Review your codebase for potential performance bottlenecks, such as inefficient algorithms or unnecessary iterations. Optimize these areas to improve the overall efficiency of your application.
- Browser Caching: Configure appropriate caching headers for static assets, allowing browsers to cache them locally. This reduces the need for repeated requests, improving performance for returning visitors.

Girdle is still a work in progress and will be optimized before I consider it complete. This is a minimum viable product at the moment.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>It had been a while since I had built a program with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I decided to create a Wordle clone.

- The project uses em sizing so that the text can scale automatically without having to use clunky media queries
- The importance of testing and debugging in the development process
- The significance of keeping up with the latest web development technologies and trends
- The benefit of using version control with Git and hosting the code on Github</p>
